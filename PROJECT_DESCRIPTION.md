## üéØ **Problem Statement**

In the modern digital landscape, web applications face constant threats from malicious actors exploiting HTTP protocol vulnerabilities. URL-based attacks represent one of the most common attack vectors, including SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), directory traversal, and other sophisticated threats. Traditional security systems often lack comprehensive real-time detection capabilities and user-friendly interfaces for threat analysis.

**Key Challenges:**
- Manual analysis of suspicious URLs is time-consuming
- Lack of integrated detection systems for multiple attack types
- Insufficient real-time monitoring capabilities
- Complex threat pattern recognition requires expert knowledge
- Need for comprehensive logging and reporting systems

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Detection Methodology**

### **Pattern-Based Analysis:**
```python
# Regex Pattern Matching
SQL_PATTERNS = [
    r"('|(\\x27)|(\\x2D)|(\\x23))",     # Quote and hex encoding
    r"union.*select",                    # UNION SELECT attacks
    r"drop.*table",                      # DROP TABLE attempts
    r"exec.*xp_",                        # Extended procedures
]

XSS_PATTERNS = [
    r"<script[^>]*>.*</script>",        # Script tag injection
    r"javascript:",                      # JavaScript protocol
    r"<img.*onerror",                   # Image event handlers
    r"alert\(",                         # Alert function calls
]
```

### **Risk Assessment Algorithm:**
```python
# Severity Scoring System
SEVERITY_MAP = {
    'sql_injection': 4,        # High - Data breach risk
    'command_injection': 5,    # Critical - System compromise
    'xss': 3,                 # Medium - Session hijacking
    'directory_traversal': 3,  # Medium - File system access
    'ssrf': 4,                # High - Internal network access
}

# Confidence Calculation
confidence = (pattern_matches / total_patterns) * base_confidence
severity = max(attack_severities) if attacks_detected else 'none'
```
